# MailBot

Steps to be followed:

1: Run the program

2: Select to whom you want to send mail

3: What is the subject of your mail

4: Tell your content of mail

The bot will then ask you if you want to send more emails.

If you want to send more emails simply say yes(same 4 steps to be followed again), otherwise no

You don't even need to type a single character throughout the entire process.
